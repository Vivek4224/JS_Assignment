What is Condition Statement? 
ans:- A Condition Statement (also called a Conditional Statement) is a programming construct that allows the execution of certain code based on whether a condition (or set of conditions) is true or false. It helps control the flow of a program by deciding which code block to execute depending on specific conditions. 

1. If Statement: It is used to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

# Syntax

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if condition is true
}


# Example

let age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}


2. If-Else Statement: It executes one block of code if the condition is true, and a different block if the condition is false.

# Syntax

if (condition) {
  // Code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if condition is false
}



# Example

let age = 15;
if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}


3. Else If Statement: It allows checking multiple conditions. If the first condition is false, it checks the next one.

# Syntax

if (condition1) {
  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // Code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
}


# Example

let age = 70;
if (age < 18) {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
} else if (age >= 18 && age < 60) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a senior.");
}


2. Switch Statement: It is used to check multiple conditions based on the value of a single expression.

# Syntax

switch(expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression equals value2
    break;
  default:
    // Code to be executed if no case matches
}


# Example

let day = 3;
switch(day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}
