What is a Loop and Switch Case in JavaScript define that ? 
ans:- A loop is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Loops are used to automate repetitive tasks and process multiple items in arrays, objects, or other data structures.

1. For Loop:- The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or a block of statements.

# Syntax

for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // Code to be executed
}

# Example

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}


#Output

0
1
2
3
4


2. While Loop:- The while loop runs as long as the condition is true. It's used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop will execute.

# Syntax

while (condition) {
  // Code to be executed
}


# Example

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}


#Output

0
1
2
3
4



3. Do-While Loop:- The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the code block is executed, ensuring that the code runs at least once.

# Syntax

do {
  // Code to be executed
} while (condition);

# Example

let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

#Output

0
1
2
3
4



4. Switch Case:- A switch case is a control structure that allows you to test multiple conditions based on the value of a variable or expression. It's used when you have many conditions to check, and using multiple if-else statements would be inefficient or difficult to read.

# Syntax

switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code to be executed if expression === value2
    break;
  // Additional cases as needed
  default:
    // Code to be executed if expression doesn't match any case
}


# Example

let day = 3;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Thursday");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("Sunday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}


# Output

Wednesday
