How many type of Variable in JavaScript?
Ans:- In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data. They are created using the var, let, or const keyword.

1. var Keyword
The var keyword is used to declare a variable. It has a function-scoped or globally-scoped behavior.

#Example

var a = "Hello Geeks"
var b = 10;
var c = 12;
var d = b + c;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(d);

# Output

Hello Geeks
10
12
22


2. let Keyword
The let keyword is a block-scoped variables. It’s commonly used for variables that may change their value.

#Example

let a = "Hello learners"
let b = "joining";
let c = " 12";
let d = b + c;

console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(c);
console.log(d);

#Output

Hello learners
joining
 12
joining 12


3. const Keyword
The const keyword declares variables that cannot be reassigned. It’s block-scoped as well.

#Example

const a = "Hello learners"
console.log(a);

const b = 400;
console.log(b);

const c = "12";
console.log(c);
// Can not change a value for a constant
// c = "new"
// console.log(c) will show error

#Output

Hello learners
400
12
